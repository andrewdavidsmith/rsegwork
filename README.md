RSEG
====

The RSEG software package is used to analyze ChIP-Seq data, especially
for identifying genomic regions and their boundaries marked by
diffusive histone modification markers, such as H3K36me3 and
H3K27me3. It can work with or without control sample. It can be used
to find regions with differential histone modifications patterns,
either comparsion between two cell types or between two kinds of
histone modifications.
